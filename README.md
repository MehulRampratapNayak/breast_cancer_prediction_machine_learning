##Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

1.  According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of women each year and affecting countries at all levels of modernization.

2.  1 in 8 women in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime

3.  On average, every 2 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States.

4.  There are over 3.5 million breast cancer survivors in the United States

5.  Breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, except for skin cancers. It is estimated that in 2020, approximately 30% of all new women cancer diagnoses will be breast cancer.

## What Is Breast Cancer? 
Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. 

## Understanding Breast Cancer
Cancer is a broad term for a class of diseases characterized by abnormal cells that grow and invade  healthy cells in the body.  Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast as a group of cancer cells that can then invade surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body.

## What Causes Cancer To Develop?
Cancer begins in the cells which are the basic building blocks that make up tissue. Tissue is found in the breast and other parts of the body.  Sometimes, the process of cell growth goes wrong and new cells form when the body doesn’t need them and old or damaged cells do not die as they should.  When this occurs, a build up of cells often forms a mass of tissue called a lump, growth, or tumor.

Breast cancer occurs when malignant tumors develop in the breast.  These cells can spread by breaking away from the original tumor and entering blood vessels or lymph vessels, which branch into tissues throughout the body. When cancer cells travel to other parts of the body and begin damaging other tissues and organs, the process is called metastasis.


## Breast Cancer Symptoms and Signs
Many breast cancer symptoms are invisible and not noticeable without a professional screening, but some symptoms can be caught early just by being proactive about your breast health. 

- A Change In How The Breast Or Nipple Looks Or Feels
  - Nipple tenderness or a lump or thickening in or near the breast or underarm area
  - A change in the skin texture or an enlargement of pores in the skin of the breast  (some describe this as similar to an orange peel’s texture)
  - A lump in the breast (It’s important to remember that all lumps should be investigated by a healthcare professional, but not all lumps are cancerous.)
- A Change In The Breast Or Nipple Appearance
  - Any unexplained change in the size or shape of the breast
  - Dimpling anywhere on the breast
  - Unexplained swelling of the breast (especially if on one side only)
  - Unexplained shrinkage of the breast (especially if on one side only)
  - Recent asymmetry (unequal or lack of sameness) of the breasts. Although it is common for women to have one breast that is slightly larger than the other, if the onset of asymmetry is recent, it should be checked.
  - Nipple that is turned slightly inward or inverted
  - Skin of the breast, areola, or nipple that becomes scaly, red, or swollen or may have ridges or pitting resembling the skin of an orange
- Any Nipple Discharge - Particularly Clear Discharge Or Bloody Discharge
  - It is also important to note that a milky discharge that is present when a woman is not breastfeeding should be checked by her doctor, although it is not linked with breast cancer.
  - Let your doctor know about any nipple discharge, clear, bloody or milky. The most concerning discharges are bloody or clear.

## Benign Tumors
When a tumor is diagnosed as benign, doctors will usually leave it alone rather than remove it. Even though these tumors are not generally aggressive toward surrounding tissue, occasionally they may continue to grow, pressing on other tissue and causing pain or other problems. In these situations, the tumor is removed, allowing pain or complications to subside.

## Malignant tumors
Malignant tumors are cancerous and may be aggressive because they invade and damage surrounding tissue. When a tumor is suspected to be malignant, the doctor will perform a biopsy to determine the severity or aggressiveness of the tumor.

## Adipose Tissue
The female breast is mostly made up of a collection of fat cells called adipose tissue. This tissue extends from the collarbone down to the underarm and across to the middle of the ribcage. As a woman ages, especially once she reaches menopause, the breast tissue contains more adipose (fatty) tissue.

## Lobes, Lobules, And Milk Ducts
A healthy female breast is made up of 12–20 sections called lobes. Each of these lobes is made up of many smaller lobules, the gland that produces milk in nursing women. Both the lobes and lobules are connected by milk ducts, which act as stems or tubes to carry the milk to the nipple. These breast structures are generally where the cancer begins to form.

## Environmental And Lifestyle Risk Factors
**Lack of Physical Activity:**  A sedentary lifestyle with little physical activity can increase your risk for breast cancer.

**Poor Diet:**  A diet high in saturated fat and lacking fruits and vegetables can increase your risk for breast cancer.  

**Being Overweight or Obese:**  Being overweight or obese can increase your risk for breast cancer. Your risk is increased if you have already gone through menopause.  

**Drinking Alcohol:**  Frequent consumption of alcohol can increase your risk for breast cancer. The more alcohol you consume, the greater the risk. 

**Combined Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):**  Taking combined hormone replacement therapy, as prescribed for menopause, can increase your risk for breast cancer and increases the risk that the cancer will be detected at a more advanced stage.

**Radiation to the Chest:**  Having radiation therapy to the chest before the age of 30 can increase your risk for breast cancer. 

## Genetic Factors
**Gender:** Breast cancer occurs nearly 100 times more often in women than in men.

**Age:** Two out of three women with invasive cancer are diagnosed after age 55.

**Race:** Breast cancer is diagnosed more often in Caucasian women than women of other races.

**Obesity:** Obesity is a risk factor for both men and women.

**Family History and Genetic Factors:** If your mother, sister, father or child has been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer, you have a higher risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer in the future. Your risk increases if your relative was diagnosed before the age of 50.  

**Personal Health History:** If you have been diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of being diagnosed with breast cancer in the other breast in the future. Also, your risk increases if abnormal breast cells have been detected before (such as atypical hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)).

**Menstrual and Reproductive History:** Early menstruation (before age 12), late menopause (after 55), having your first child at an older age, or never having given birth can also increase your risk for breast cancer.

**Certain Genome Changes:** Mutations in certain genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase your risk for breast cancer. This is determined through a genetic test, which you may consider taking if you have a family history of breast cancer. Individuals with these gene mutations can pass the gene mutation onto their children.

**Dense Breast Tissue:** Having dense breast tissue can increase your risk for breast cancer and make lumps harder to detect. Several states have passed laws requiring physicians to disclose to women if their mammogram indicates that they have dense breasts so that they are aware of this risk. Be sure to ask your physician if you have dense breasts and what the implications of  having dense breasts are.

## Known Risk Factors
Women with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop breast cancer. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors (such as drinking alcohol) can be avoided. But most risk factors (such as having a family history of breast cancer) can’t be avoided. Having a risk factor does not mean that a woman will get breast cancer. Many women who have risk factors never develop breast cancer.

## These Do Not Cause Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is not contagious; you can’t contract cancer from a person who has the disease.
Breast cancer is not caused by wearing underwire bras, implants, deodorants, antiperspirants, mammograms, caffeine, plastic food serving items, microwaves, or cell phones, as myths often suggest.

## Good News About Breast Cancer Trends
In recent years, perhaps coinciding with the decline in prescriptive hormone replacement therapy after menopause, we have seen a gradual reduction in female breast cancer incidence rates among women aged 50 and older. Death rates from breast cancer have been declining since about 1990, in part due to better screening and early detection, increased awareness, and continually improving treatment options.
